      <p> I believe that we have a righteous wind at our backs and that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices, and meet the challenges that face us. This union may never be perfect, but generation after generation has shown that it can always be perfected. Unlike Afghanistan, Iraq was a war of choice that provoked strong differences in my country and around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pundits, the pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into Red States and Blue States; Red States for Republicans, Blue States for Democrats. And in all these ways, they helped make this country more decent and more just. But I'm hopeful because I think there's an awakening taking place in America. There is a young, twenty-three year old white woman named Ashley Baia who organized for our campaign in Florence, South Carolina. That's why I stand here tonight. Words alone cannot meet the needs of our people.
        And so this will be a difficult debate next week. Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to be part of something larger. We can pounce on some gaffe by a Hillary supporter as evidence that she's playing the race card, or we can speculate on whether white men will all flock to John McCain in the general election regardless of his policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        And it's a lesson we need to remember today - as members of another Joshua generation. Like other predominantly black churches across the country, Trinity embodies the black community in its entirety - the doctor and the welfare mom, the model student and the former gang-banger. For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past. So let there be no doubt: Islam is a part of America. Without these ingredients, elections alone do not make true democracy. Americans are ready to join with citizens and governments; community organizations, religious leaders, and businesses in Muslim communities around the world to help our people pursue a better life.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) works to provide equal housing in the United States. It works on maintaining affordable housing nationwide. Furthermore, this department also handles issues of housing discrimination and assists first-time home buyers.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development is the parent of the Federal Housing Administration, which was established as part of the National Housing Act of 1934, which was part of the New Deal following the Great Depression. The FHA works to improve housing stadards and provide relatively managable mortgage loans and insurance. It is the only government agency that operates on a self-generated income (it receives its fundings from the proceeds from the mortgage insurance) instead of relying on taxpayers.
